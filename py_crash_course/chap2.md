## Notes

* A constant is a variable whose value remains the same throughout the life of a program. Want to treat a variable as a constant in the code, make the name of the variable in all capital letters.
  ```python
   MAX_CONNECTION = 5000
  ```
* Comments are extremely useful features in writing codes.
  *   explain what the code is supposed to do
  *   how we make it work

* The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  
      Beautiful is better than ugly    
      Simple is better than complex  
      Complex is better than complicated
      Readbility counts  
      There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it  
      Now better than never

Please write three functions: first_word, second_word and last_word. Each function takes a string argument.  
As their names imply, the functions return either the first, the second or the last word in the sentence they receive as their string argument.  
In each case you may assume the argument string contains at least two separate words, and all words are separated by exactly one space character. There will be no spaces in the beginning or at the end of the argument strings.

sentence.find(' ') to find the space index in a sentence.  
sentence.rfind(' ') to find the **last** space index in a sentence

```python

def first_word(sentence):
    space_index = sentence.find(' ')
    return sentence[:space_index]

def second_word(sentence):
    first_space = sentence.find(' ')
    second_space = sentence.find(' ', first_space + 1)

    # Make sure to handle the case where there is no second space
    if second_space == -1:
        return sentence[first_space + 1:]
    return sentence[first_space + 1:second_space]

def last_word(sentence):
    last_space = sentence.rfind(' ')
    return sentence[last_space + 1:]


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":

    sentence = "it was a dark and stormy python"

    print(first_word(sentence))   # it
    print(second_word(sentence)) # was
    print(last_word(sentence))   # python

    
# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sentence = "once upon a time there was a programmer"
    print(first_word(sentence))
    print(second_word(sentence))
    print(last_word(sentence))
```
